# 1. What does the if do to the code under it?
# 2. Why does the code under if get indented four spaces?
# 3. What happens if it isn't indented?
# 4. Can you put other Boolean expressions from exercise 27 in the if statement? Try it.
# 5. What happens if you change the initial values for people, cats, and dogs?
